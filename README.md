Cell99
================================
Cellular Automata Engine in C99
--------------------------------

### About 
Cell99 is a unique game/engine for building cellular automata based systems. It is based
on using an Entity-Component-System architecture.

### Dependencies
This project uses *[Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs)*, so it is required to have both flecs.h & flecs.c in the include/ directory. 

Both files **_need_** to match the version of the dynamic library (flecs.dylib, flecs.so) that is being linked against.
